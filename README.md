#Rotten Tomatoes Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Pipeline
#Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to analyze movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation for sentiment classification or rating prediction.

#Objective
The primary goal is to:

#Analyze movie reviews and ratings.
Build a machine learning model to predict sentiments (positive/negative) or review scores.
Create a reusable, well-documented pipeline for movie review sentiment analysis.

#Dataset
The dataset used includes Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews with:
Textual reviews.
Sentiment labels (Positive/Negative) or numerical ratings.
Source: [Mention dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, etc.]

#Pipeline Steps
The following steps are implemented in the Jupyter Notebook:
1. Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset.
Clean the text data:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
Handle missing values and duplicates.
2. Feature Engineering
Convert text data into numerical format using:
TF-IDF Vectorizer or Count Vectorizer.
Optional: Use Word2Vec for embeddings.
Perform train-test split.
3. Model Building
Trained multiple machine learning models, including:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier
Optional: Implemented deep learning with LSTM or BERT.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance using:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
Visualized results for better understanding.
5. Pipeline Integration
Combined preprocessing, training, and evaluation into a single pipeline for reusability.
